# Noodle
This is a simple game where your character must move
to avoid obstacles and to hit targets.

## Todo list
- [ ] export to mobile and figure out touch controls
- [ ] make something cool happen when you capture obstacles in a tail circle
- [ ] add logic and labels for health and kill counters
- [ ] replace legacy creep assets
- [ ] add targets that collide with the head to grant bonus points
- [ ] port actionrpg hiteffects to complete the hurtbox script (animatedSprite -> HitEffect.png, audiostreamplayer -> Hit.wav)
